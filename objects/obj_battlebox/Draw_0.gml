// obj_battlebox's origin is top-left, but box_angle needs to rotate the

// top-left origin and send the box swinging off to the side), we manually
// offset the draw position: find where the top-left corner needs to be
// drawn so that, once rotated, the visible center still lands exactly on
// the box's actual center point.
